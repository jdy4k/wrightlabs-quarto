title: "Connecting to the Cluster"
---

To use the Linux-based computer Cluster housed at Juniata College, you
have to connect remotely to the supercomputer. This can be done through
any computer running MacOS or Windows using a secure shell session,
also called **ssh**. Many bioinformatics pipelines are built for a
Linux environment because of its power and flexibility when working
with large amounts of data. Linux is an operating system much like
Unix, but unlike Windows and MacOS operating systems, it runs primarily
through a command line interface rather than the visible desktop to
which many of us are accustomed. Through this interface of the Cluster
users are able to select many options and parameters in running its
installed programs.

## Via SSH on Windows
If you have a PC running a windows operating system, you will need to
download [PuTTY](http://www.chiark.greenend.org.uk/\~sgtatham/putty/download.html).

Upon opening PuTTY, this a window should appear.

* Ensure that "SSH" is selected for "Connection Type."

* Type your username (then enter) and password in the terminal window.

## Warning

As you type your password, it will not show anything at all (not even
asterisks or dots as you type). There is a password there even if you
cannot see it! Be brave! If the password is typed incorrectly, press
enter to again reveal the password prompt and start over.

## Via SSH on MacOs

Open the terminal application to bring up the command line interface
that will allow you to connect to the Cluster. Type `ssh 
your_username_here@147.73.20.123` followed by enter, then your
password.

## Via Cyberduck

To help view and edit files on the Cluster, both Mac and Windows users
can install the program “Cyberduck” on their computer:

     new Cluster
