Bioinformatics requires a machine much stronger than the computers we
use in daily life. It is helpful to have access to a Cluster
computer—such as the one housed at Juniata College—to complete our

1. Connect to Juniata's wifi when off campus
2. Remotely connect to Juniata's Cluster from your personal computer's terminal
3. Basics of working in a Linux terminal
4. How the Cluster operates
