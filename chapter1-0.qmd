Bioinformatics requires a machine much stronger than the computers we
use in daily life. It is helpful to have access to a Cluster
computer—such as the one housed at Juniata College—to complete our
analysis. In this tutorial, you will learn how to:

- Connect to Juniata's wifi when off campus
- Remotely connect to Juniata's Cluster from your personal computer's terminal
- Basics of working in a Linux terminal
- How the Cluster operates
