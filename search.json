    "text": "Purchased via an HHMI grant, the Juniata College Cluster is vital to analyzing genetic data. We have since purchased another, which was made possible by a donation from Wright Labs. Anyway, this section describe how this miniature supercomputer is structured so that we can use it effectively for analysis. The Cluster is fundamentally different from the laptops and desktops we frequently work with, not just because it runs Linux, but because it is composed of several powerful computers Clustered together.\nEach powerful computer of the Cluster is called a “node.” The head node is at the top. You use this node to access your data and programs. The worker nodes are underneath the head node; they complete jobs assigned to them.\nUsers interact with the Cluster as depicted below:\nflowchart TD\n    A[You] --&gt;|Your Hands| B(Laptop)\n    B --&gt;|SSH Session| C{Head Node}\n    C --&gt;|Job| D[Worker Node 1]\n    C --&gt;|Job| E[Worker Node 2]\n    C --&gt;|Job| F[Worker Node 3]\n    C --&gt;|Job| G[Worker Node 4]",

    "text": "Running jobs\nEverything you can do on a normal Linux system, you can also do on the Cluster. But, you will want to run all of your programs off the worker nodes rather than the head node. You connect to the head node with ssh and submit jobs to the worker nodes through the command line. It is dangerous to execute programs on the head node since it may cause the supercomputer to crash. To prevent this, we run jobs on the worker nodes, which can easily be done in three steps:\n\n\nCreate a job.sh script containing the commands to run our program (giftwrap the script)\nSubmit the script using sbatch (give the script to the worker node)\nCheck on the status of our job using squeue (see if the worker node is actively running the commands)\n\nYou can use watch squeue to see your job’s status be continually updated\nTo exit that, use CTRL + c\n\n\n\nThroughout this tutorial you will see how to submit scripts to a worker node using sbatch and how to check the status of running scripts using watch squeue. It is important to remember to check the output locations of the programs you are running for later access.",

    "text": "Anatomy of a script\nAll of the scripts that you will be using for this tutorial are already made. However, a brief description of their various components will hopefully help you better understand how they work and make your own, should the need arise.\n\n\n1#!/bin/bash\n2# PBS -l nodes=1:ppn=6\n3#PBS -N qiime2 import\n#PBS -j oe\n\n4#=======================================================#\n#   Imports raw fastq reads into a QIIME 2 artifact\n#\n#   June 29, 2018\n#=======================================================#\n\n# Set your working directory to where you have your raw data sequence\n5workdir=/home/see/Wright_Labs/Connors_B_11.19/\n6cd $workdir\n\n7source activate qiime2-2019.7\n\n# Before running script make a mapping file as described in the \n# tutorial This is important because it points to the forward \n# and reverse reads which will be imported.\n\n8qiime tools import \\\n  --type 'SampleData[PairedEndSequenceWithQuality]' \\\n  --input-path co_b.mapping.csv.txt \\\n  --output-path co_b.paired-end-demux.qza \\\n  --input-format PairedEndFastqManifestPhred33\n\n1\n\nSpecifies the coding language of the script\n\n2\n\nSpecifies the number of nodes and ppn to allocate to the job. (higher the pnn, the more resources are allocated to the job)\n\n3\n\nSpecifies the name of the job as seen when you do qstat or watch qstat\n\n4\n\nThis box just gives a brief description of what the script does. It does not impact the job itself.\n\n5\n\nSpecifies the value for ‘workdir’\n\n6\n\nChanges the working directory to the value of ‘workdir’\n\n7\n\n‘Soure activate’ is a command that activates an environment specified in the script. In this case, it is the qiime2-2019.7 environment.\n\n8\n\nHere is the main command that we are running. We run the qiime tools import command with a few flags.\n\n\nHover over the numbers to the right of the code above to see annotations.\nThere is a lot in the above image to unpack. Basically, the scripts that you will be using can be divided into three sections,\n\n\nThe topmost (in the black rectangle) gives general information about the script itself.\n\nThings like which language the script is written in (we use BASH) and how much resources to allocate to that job are here\n\nThe next section (in the gray rectangle) is just a description of what the script does.\n\nThis does not impact the job itself; it’s just to give the user more information about the script.\n\nThe last section (in the pink rectangle) is the meat of the script, so to speak. It tells the Cluster what you actually want it to do.\n\nIn the above script, we are telling the Cluster to move into the folder as specified by the workdir variable, then activate the qiime2-2019.7 environment, and finally run the qiime tools import command with a few flags\n\n\n\nTwo symbols that you will see a lot in our scripts are # and \\.\nIn general, # tells the Cluster to ignore that line and continue on with the script. These lines are referred to as comments. The exceptions to this are in the black box above. But, everywhere else, the comments, as denoted by #, are just skipped.\n\\ tells the Cluster that the command is continued on the next line. So, the qiime tools import command above is equivalent to:\nPut your cursor over the code below and scroll to the right.\nqiime tools import --type 'SampleData[PairedEndSequenceWithQuality]' --input-path co_b.mapping.csv.txt --output-path co_b.paired-end-demux.qza --input-format PairedEndFastqManifestPhred33\nAs you can see (kind of), that command gets pretty long, so we use the \\’s to make it more viewable within our scripts.\nFor a more viewable example ls -l ~ is equivalent to:\nls \\\n-l \\\n~\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTipWhat do you think would happen if we submitted the above script with a # before source activate?\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTipWhere would we expect to find the output file for the above script?\n\n\n\n\n\nHint\n\nWhat is the purpose of setting the workdir variable; how is it being used?\n\n\n\nI should also note that the text editor that I am using (Notepad++) applies formatting to make the scripts easier to understand, e.g. making commented sections green. The text editor you are using may not do that, but as long as you remember what the different characters mean, you should not have an issue understanding the scripts.",

    "text": "Editing and submitting scripts\nThere are a couple ways to edit scripts. You can edit them through the Cluster, with Putty, the terminal, or you could edit them with Cyberduck. To edit through the Cluster…\n\n\nnano [SCRIPT NAME] when you are in the same folder as the script you want to edit - For example, nano 1.2_raw_reads_import.sh\nNavigate using the arrow keys\nSet the working directory to the location of your input (typically your data directory)\nSet any input/output names and desired parameters\nSave your changes (CTRL + X)\nThen press y\nThen press ENTER\n\n\nTo edit through Cyberduck…\n\n\nRight click on the script and choose “Edit With”\nThen pick the program you want to use to edit it\nThe script should now be opened\nMake the desired changes\nGo to “File” then “Save” to save the script\n\n\nRegardless of how you edit it, you submit scripts using sbatch [SCRIPT NAME]. For instance, sbatch 1.2_raw_reads_import.sh would submit the 1.2_raw_reads_import.sh script to the head node, which would then give it to a worker node to run.\nYou can check the progress of scripts with squeue.\nTo have the progress be continuously updated, use watch squeue. You can exit watch squeue by using CTRL + C\nUnder S, there will be a letter indicating the job’s status\n\nQ - Queued (waiting to run)\nR - Running\nC - Completed or Canceled\n\nEvery script outputs a log file in the directory you were in when it was submitted, with the name of the job followed by .o+Job number So, the above script will have a file named Humann.65745.out and Humann.65745.err when it is finished, but as indicated by the R, it is currently still running\nThese log files are helpful for troubleshooting errors. The most common errors are due to incorrectly specifying your working directory or the input file(s)\nYou can also cancel your jobs, with scancel.\nIf I wanted to cancel the Humann job above, I would use scancel 65745.",

So -a may be called “the a flag.” Try running ls with this flags (shown below).\nls -a\n\n\nOutput for ls -a\n\nWhere as ls shows all normal files in your directory, ls -a will show you all the files in a directory/folder, including hidden files (these files and folders will have a period before there name, for example .config or .local)\n.config .local Documents Downloads Pictures\n\nls -l\n\n\nOutput for ls -l\n\nls -l will show you more information about those files in a long list.\ndrwxr-xr-x 6 user user 4096 Sep 26 13:31 Documents/\ndrwxr-xr-x 4 user user 4096 Sep 25 00:49 Downloads/\ndrwxr-xr-x 3 user user 4096 Sep 26 13:46 Pictures/\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTipHow would you list all files (hidden ones included) with additional information?\n\n\n\n\n\nAnswer\n\nCombining both flag in the commands ls -l -a or ls -a -l (order does not matter) will give you the desired output.

Run this, then scroll to the top of the output where you will find a line that starts with Usage: .... You should see\nls [OPTION] ... [FILE] ...\n\n\nls: simply the command name\nOPTION is where you put your options or flags. You can think of options as modifiers of the command. In this case, -a and -l are both flags that modify the performance of the ls command. Options are often a dash followed by a single letter, if a command has a lot of possible options, they can be two dashes followed by a word.\nFILE is the folder that you are running ls on. You can think of it as the target of ls. So, running: ls /home will list all files in /home instead of listing files in your current directory.\n[] (the brackets) show that the OPTION flags and the FILE specification are optional. Basically, you do not have to include -a or even a folder to use ls. So the command ls alone is legal even though it has no flags or files.\n. . .

Typing pwd will print the working directory, whereas cd will change our directory to the location of our choosing (by default, to work within your home folder).\nBefore we start exploring the Cluster using cd and ls, let’s take a moment to describe the file structure of a Linux machine. Though you cannot see it all at once, this is how some of the directory structure looks inside the Cluster. For example, notice how user accounts are all inside of /home/.\n/  &lt;------------------------ \"root directory\"\n  bin/\n  dev/\n  home/  &lt;------------------ \"home directory\"\n    399group1/\n    299group2/\n    username/  &lt;------------ \"YOUR home directory\"\n      yourfiles/\n    sabey/\n      16S_tutorial/\n        data/\n        jc_qime_pipeline/\n    otheruseraccounts/\n  share/\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNoteNote\n\n\n\nWhen the term “your home directory” is used in this tutorial, we are referring to the directory created according to your account username, NOT the encompassing directory named /home (see diagram above).\n\n\nTo list your current location within this structure, try typing:\npwd\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTipBased on the results, where are you currently located in the file directory?\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNow let’s go to the root directory, at the very top of the diagram above:\ncd /\nUse ls to see the contents of this directory, then move into the share folder, then into the apps directory within it:\ncd home/share\ncd apps\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTipWhat is the full path of the directory we are in now?\n\n\n\n\n\nHint\n\nUse pwd.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTipWhat are the contents of the apps directory?\n\n\n\n\n\nHint\n\nUse ls.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTipHow could we have moved into the apps folder with a single command (instead of three)?\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNow that we have moved all the way into /home/share/apps, let’s move back into /home/share. There are two ways to do this:\nGo ‘up one directory’ by typing:\ncd ..\nUse an absolute path by typing:\ncd /home/share\nThis will take you directly to the /share directory regardless of your position beforehand. It is called an absolute path because it starts all the way back at the root of all directories. Notice how this path starts with a forward slash (/), since that is the root of the file structure.\nExplore other directories using cd foldername to move into a folder, ls to list the files inside, and cd .. to go up and out of that directory. If you ever get lost, you can type pwd to print your current location. You can also type cd all by itself to return to your home directory.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTipWhat is the location of your home folder?\n\n\n\n\n\nHint\n\nUse cd then pwd.\n\n\n\nAnother very convenient feature of Linux that is especially useful for typing long file name, is auto-completion. When you are typing the name of a file or folder, you can press TAB to autocomplete the rest.\nFor example, if the only directory within /home/ that begins with “sa” is “sabey”, typing cd /home/sa followed by pressing TAB will autocomplete the path to /home/sabey. Try this to change into your own directory.",

Are you required to use any of them?\nWhat happends when you run the following command, and why does that make sense?\nwget\n\n\nAfter your PCR amplicons are sequenced, the sequencing core will upload the data to a website from which it can be downloaded. In a web browser, you can click on various files to download them, but in a terminal, you instead use wget. Let’s practice with some sample data:\nDownloading files through the terminal:\n\n\nOpen this link in a web browser.\nScroll to the bottom and find the file called simm.tar.gz.\nRight-click that link.\nChoose “copy link” or “copy link address.”\nIn your folder, type wget followed by a space, then paste the link you just copied (If you are using PuTTY, you will have to right click to paste instead of using Ctrl + V )\n\n\ncd linux_practice\nwget http://www.drive5.com/uchime/simm.tar.gz\n\n\nPress enter to run wget and download the indicated file",

    "text": "Using gzip to compress and decompress files\nLooking at the file you just downloaded, you will notice its name ends with tar.gz, which tells us two things. First, .tar means it is a whole folder inside of a single file (called a tarball). Second, .gz means the file is compressed with gzip.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTipHow large is the file you just downloaded? (Hint: use ls with these two flags: -l, which produces a long list, and -h which displays the file sizes in a human-readable format). The file sizes will appear just to the left of the file names.\n\n\n\nAlso, (again) write down the first two lines of gzip --help.\n\n\nTo decompress the file we just downloaded, run:\ngzip -d simm.tar.gz\nYou can also use the command gunzip (literally “g” + “unzip”). gzip -d and gunzip complete the same task. Remember that you can also use TAB to autocomplete file names as you type them in.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTipUsing the same ls -lh command, what is the size of the file now?\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTipWhat is the compression percentage of gzip on this file?\n\n\n\n\n\nHint\n\nDivide the .tar.gz file size by the .tar file size and do not forget to convert Mb to Kb, where 1 Mb = 1024 Kb\n\n\n\nFor practice using gzip, let’s recompress the file you just decompressed by using one the options from the help tab.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWarningWarning\n\n\n\nOmit the -d when you run this command since we are not decompressing!\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTipWhy might gzip be useful for large data files like the genetic data in our 16S sequences?",
